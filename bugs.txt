check out comment it LevelTools.gravity.  There may be a problem with gravity.
attracting is gaining energy in at least cvcp - response: seems stable with ~200 dots in static container

Stuff to do
-hypo path
-loading graphs (command?)


performance notes - .apply() is trivially slower than just calling the function.  However
.apply(someVar) is ~ 20% slower.  Same if you just use undefined.  May be lookup time or something.  Still takes trivially little time (400 - 800 ms per million.  ~400 for apply(), ~800 for apply(someVar))

Make slow down time thing by multiplying v (and piston motion, dividing by const for pInt) by const
Make buttons smaller

Test q rate/ammt arrows

SUBTRACT HEATER VOL OFF
make it so you can generate phase diagrams
change expressions for state listeners too
