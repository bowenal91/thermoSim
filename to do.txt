implement dot migrator queue
fix wall collision to make dots not get trapped in heater


performance notes - .apply() is trivially slower than just calling the function.  However
.apply(someVar) is ~ 20% slower.  Same if you just use undefined since it's looking up the variable undefined Still takes trivially little time (400 - 800 ms per million.  ~400 for apply(), ~800 for apply(someVar))

Make slow down time thing by multiplying v (and piston motion, dividing by const for pInt) by const
