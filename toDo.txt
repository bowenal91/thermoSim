To do:
in Work: I changed atm to bar without changing any values like mass or whatever.  Reccomend checking values
should probably make conditions and remove be addable to prompt instead of block of specified

MAKE RMS BE CONSISTANTLY GOTTEN - currently you have the dot speed function which uses pxToMS and the 3/2kT = 1/2mv^2 way.  NOT OKAY
OR - just calculate px to ms based on the 3/2kt stuff and v->t conversion (tconst I guess)


Change equation CE to something that matches well with BR, LIKE /P?


in ideal gas eqs: boltzmann constant: K -> K_{b}

URISC FINAL REPORT BY SEPT 28th



make appendLastAns or something
	could just manually throw in last answer. w/e

Clear up how walls border and extend border 

At some point, make graph point data be stored using Point class rather than having .x, .y attribute in set.  Seriously

---
make sign is V\Delta Pext negative
P_sys to just P
so we have Pext and P instead of Pext and Pint
Label pictures state 1, state 2
make fonts in pictures smaller, more Pext out of system to top of piston

do expansion step after compression

give answer box for slope of T vs. V graph
from the graph, slope 
from the equation, slope is

add on to end
Now we'll look at expanding the same system, calculate work

make saveState function
