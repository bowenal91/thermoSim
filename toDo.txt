To do:
in Work: I changed atm to bar without changing any values like mass or whatever.  Reccomend checking values
should probably make conditions and remove be addable to prompt instead of block of specified

Make function that takes info (spcName, tags), returns list of dots.  That would get rid of all these lame else ifs

MAKE RMS BE CONSISTANTLY GOTTEN - currently you have the dot speed function which uses pxToMS and the 3/2kT = 1/2mv^2 way.  NOT OKAY
OR - just calculate px to ms based on the 3/2kt stuff and v->t conversion (tconst I guess)


Change equation CE to something that matches well with BR, LIKE /P?


in ideal gas eqs: boltzmann constant: K -> K_{b}

URISC FINAL REPORT BY SEPT 28th


Ooh - when adding a tag, just compile a list of dots with that tag.  There can be like a tagged object and it can contain lists of tagged dots.  Dots also appear in their corresponding spcs element
