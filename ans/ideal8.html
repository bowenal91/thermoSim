You'd need to make L<sub>x</sub> scale linearly with average molecular velocity.  In one dimension, time between collisions is equal to L/v, with L being a side length and v being velocity.  If we increase container length linearly with velocity, we hold the number of collisions constant.  This means we're increasing volume linearly with speed as well.  So if we substitute V avg in for volume, we'll get:

Scaling V with velocity and substituting in kinetic energy for temperature,

Dividing over, we get

So, if we can make a container that expands linearly with average molecular velocity, we can make pressure scale only with how hard the molecules hit the container, since the number of collisions is held constant.  Since temperature is proportional to V<sup>2</sup>, this means P would be proportional to T<sup>0.5</sup>.

Remember, this is <i>not</i> for the general case, this is only for our magical container that expands linearly with average molecular velocity.
